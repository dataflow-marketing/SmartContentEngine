# SmartContentEngine Service

SmartContentEngine is now migrating to a **web service** that allows you to automate content crawling, processing and enrichment over HTTP.

No more manual CLI steps — deploy the service, confirm it’s running, and make HTTP requests to process your web content pipeline.
 (scrape, summarise, extract narratives, interests, segments, and reports).
